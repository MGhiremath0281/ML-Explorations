# Spam Email Classification using SVM with RBF Kernel

## Project Overview:
This project is a part of the learning process to build a **Spam Email Classification Model** using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm with an **RBF Kernel**. The objective is to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** based on various features derived from the email content and metadata.

### Key Highlights:
- **Accuracy**: 51% (0.505)
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Balanced performance for both spam and non-spam emails.
- **Features Used**: Subject length, body length, number of links, spam keyword count, presence of suspicious words, and other email-related metadata.

### Challenges Faced:
- **Data Imbalance**: The class imbalance led to challenges in detecting spam accurately.
- **Feature Engineering**: Some features were not very informative for classification.
- **Model Tuning**: The model's performance can be improved with better hyperparameter tuning and further data preprocessing.

### Future Improvements:
- **Feature Engineering**: Improve the feature set with more relevant attributes.
- **Handling Data Imbalance**: Techniques such as **SMOTE** or **class weighting** can help balance the dataset.
- **Model Exploration**: Try alternative models like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, or **Deep Learning**.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conduct a more detailed search for optimal parameters.
