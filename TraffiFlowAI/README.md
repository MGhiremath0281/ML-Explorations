# Traffic Volume Prediction Model Report

## Problem Statement:

Traffic congestion is one of the most significant urban challenges, leading to delays, increased fuel consumption, and pollution. Accurate prediction of traffic volume helps urban planners, traffic management authorities, and logistics companies to make informed decisions, reduce congestion, and optimize traffic flow. This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the traffic volume based on various factors, including the time of the day, location, and weather conditions.

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts traffic volume given the following input features:

- **Month of the year (1-12)**
- **Location (e.g., Koramangala, Whitefield, etc.)**
- **Weather condition (Clear, Rain, Fog, Snow)**
- **Hour of the day (0-23)**

## Approach:

The project followed a structured approach, involving the following steps:

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing:

- **Data Collection:** The dataset contains traffic data with features such as `Month`, `Location`, `Weather`, `Hour`, and `Traffic Volume`.
- **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was checked for missing values and outliers. After thorough inspection, it was observed that the dataset did not have outliers, and missing values were handled appropriately.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:**
  - The `Location` and `Weather` columns were categorical, and we used **One-Hot Encoding** to convert them into numerical format. This method created new binary columns for each category of the categorical variable.
- **Feature Scaling:** The continuous numerical variables, such as `Month`, `Hour`, and the encoded variables, were scaled using **StandardScaler**. This step ensured that all features had the same scale, improving the model's performance and convergence speed.

### 2. Model Development:

- **Train-Test Split:** The dataset was split into training and testing datasets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing. This allowed the model to be trained on a larger dataset and tested on a smaller unseen dataset.
- **Model Selection:** A **Linear Regression** model was chosen as the baseline model for predicting traffic volume. Linear Regression is simple, interpretable, and performs well when there is a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
- **Model Training:** The Linear Regression model was trained using the training data, and the features were fitted to the target variable (Traffic Volume).

### 3. Model Evaluation:

#### Metrics Used:

- **R-squared:** A measure of how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. An R-squared value of 0.859 indicated that the model could explain a good portion of the variance in traffic volume.
- **Adjusted R-squared:** This adjusted metric accounts for the number of predictors in the model and indicated a slight penalty for overfitting.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** MSE calculated to evaluate how much the modelâ€™s predictions deviated from the true values. The model achieved an MSE of 17627.69.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The RMSE was found to be 132.77, indicating the average deviation from the actual values in the same units as the target variable.

The performance metrics indicated that the model had moderate accuracy. The high R-squared and relatively low RMSE suggest that the model can provide reasonable traffic volume predictions, though there is room for improvement.

### 4. Deployment:

- **Flask Web Application:**
  - A **Flask** web application was developed to deploy the model. The web application allows users to input the values for `Month`, `Location`, `Weather`, and `Hour`, after which the model predicts the traffic volume for that combination.
  - The web interface was designed using HTML and CSS to ensure a user-friendly experience. The form was created with input fields for each of the required features, and the prediction result is displayed on the same page.
- **Model Integration:** The trained model was saved using `pickle` and loaded in the Flask backend to make real-time predictions. When a user submits the form, the data is passed to the model, and the predicted traffic volume is returned and displayed.

## Challenges Faced:

During the development of the model, several challenges were encountered:

### 1. Data Preprocessing:

- **Handling Categorical Data:** Converting the `Location` and `Weather` columns into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding posed a challenge because it increased the dimensionality of the dataset. Careful attention was given to avoid overfitting by using the `drop_first=True` parameter.
- **Feature Scaling:** Ensuring the correct scaling of features was crucial for improving model performance, especially when using models that are sensitive to feature scaling.

### 2. Model Performance:

- **Initial Model Accuracy:** The first model showed moderate performance, with an R-squared value of 0.859. However, there was still a significant amount of error in the predictions as indicated by the high RMSE value. We considered improving the model by experimenting with more advanced techniques, such as **Random Forests** or **Gradient Boosting Machines**, to improve accuracy further.

### 3. Deployment Issues:

- **Web Application Deployment:** Integrating the model with a Flask web application for real-time predictions was challenging. It required careful handling of model input and output formatting, especially when dealing with One-Hot Encoding and feature scaling. Debugging the Flask routes and ensuring seamless integration of the model with the frontend were time-consuming tasks.

### 4. Handling New Data:

- **One-Hot Encoding for New Data:** A challenge was handling new inputs for `Location` and `Weather` during prediction. The encoding of these categorical variables required the form input from the user to match the exact columns of the training dataset. This issue was resolved by reindexing the new input data to match the columns of the training set.

## Conclusion:

The traffic volume prediction model demonstrated reasonable performance with a strong R-squared value and acceptable RMSE. While it provides valuable insights, there is potential to further improve the model's accuracy through feature engineering, advanced models, and fine-tuning. The integration of the model into a Flask web application ensures easy accessibility for users to predict traffic volume based on key features.

Further steps could involve:
- **Exploring more advanced models** such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.
- **Feature selection or engineering** to better capture the relationship between variables.
- **Model tuning** using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization.

This project highlights the practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios, such as traffic management, and serves as a foundation for further enhancements and improvements.
