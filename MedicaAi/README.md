## Model Overview

This model was developed to predict **disease prognosis** based on various symptoms and features. Although the model did not perform as expected, it provided valuable learning experiences.

## What I Learned

- **Feature Selection**: I learned how to carefully choose and process features to improve model performance.
- **Data Preprocessing**: I gained experience in handling missing data, scaling numbers, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Evaluation**: I learned how to assess model performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Future Improvements

While this model didn't achieve the desired results, I plan to make improvements in the future by:
- Using **better algorithms** and tuning the model for better accuracy.
- **Incorporating more data** to improve the model's predictions.
- Improving **evaluation methods** to ensure more reliable results.

## Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience. Although the model didn't succeed as expected, I am excited to continue improving it in future iterations.
