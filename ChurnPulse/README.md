# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts customer churn, which helps businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their services. By understanding churn patterns, companies can take proactive measures to retain customers and enhance their overall satisfaction and experience.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**, which contains the following features:

- **Customer Information**: Gender, age, tenure, etc.
- **Service Details**: Contract type, payment method, internet service, etc.
- **Usage and Charges**: Monthly charges, total charges, etc.
- **Churn Status**: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).

## Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset and identify patterns in customer churn.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and scale features for model compatibility.
3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict customer churn.
4. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance and select the best model.
5. **Insights**: Identify key factors influencing customer churn and provide actionable insights.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: For implementation and scripting.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data processing and manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing the data and results.

## Applications

- **Customer Retention**: Helps businesses identify customers who are at risk of leaving.
- **Targeted Marketing**: Enables businesses to create better retention strategies and promotions.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Aims to improve overall customer satisfaction and loyalty by addressing churn-related issues.
